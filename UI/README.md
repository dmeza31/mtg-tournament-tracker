## Configuration

### Local Development

The app automatically uses `http://localhost:8000/api/v1` for local development.

### Production/Railway Deployment

Set the `API_BASE_URL` environment variable:

```bash
export API_BASE_URL="https://your-api.railway.app/api/v1"
```

For Railway deployment instructions, see [RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT.md](../RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT.md) in the root directory.

**Railway Setup:**
- Service uses `Procfile` for automatic deployment
- Set `API_BASE_URL` environment variable to your FastAPI backend URL
- Railway automatically provides `$PORT` variable

## URL

The app will be available at: **http://localhost:8501**

## Troubleshooting

### Cannot connect to API
- Ensure the FastAPI backend is running
- Check that the API URL is correct
- Verify no firewall is blocking localhost connections

### Data not loading
- Click the "🔄 Refresh Data" button in the sidebar
- Check that you have data in your database
- Verify the database views are created (run `database/03_views.sql`)
